# Introduction - Jest for Testing in Vite-React Project

## Recommendations
****The recommended is to work with yarn my local dependecies and with npm my global dependencies and create the react project with vite so it's more fasted now and the future****

****You can run the script test though you haven't the '__tests__' folder or some file with the ends '.test.js', so in the terminal will show the tests did not be found inside into it****

## Set Up React + Vite Project
1. Install with the following command:
    ```javascript
    yarn create vite
    ```
2. Execute the command:
    ```javascript
    yarn install
    ```

3. Run the application:
    ```javascript
    yarn dev
    ```

4. Install prop-types(optional)
    ```javascript
        yarn add prop-types
    ```
